Disadvantages of Waterfall Model:
=========================================
Dev and Ops team work in Silos
Time taken to market the product is more
No intermediate deliveries
It is a rigid model 
Next phase is executed only after the previous phase has completed
Its a risky model, required more effort and costly
No new changes are accommodated once the project has been started
No window to include feedbacks from client

Disadvantages of Agile Model:
========================================
Dev and Ops team work in Silos
Deployment is done manually on a given date and time upon getting approval form all stakeholders
As Deployment is done manually if any command or file is missed by the team, the deployment will fail 
and this will bring delay in project delivery.
Infrastructure set up in Agile is done manually and when it has to be done on several servers it is time consuming.
Scaling up of infrastructure is also time consuming.
No automation tools used for Deployment or infrastructure set up

In detail responsibilties:
==========================

Service Ownership –
A devOps engineer can be part of the DevOps/SRE team, whose mission is the shared full stack ownership of a collection of services 
and/or technology areas. 
As a devops team member you will have to understand the end-to-end product, configuration, technical dependencies, 
and overall behavioral characteristics of the production services, monitoring, diagnosability, incident management, etc.

A devOps engineer works closely with development teams and will have the responsibility to ensure 
that services are designed and delivered to be mission critical with focus on security, resiliency, scale, and performance.

Service Design – you will partner with development teams in defining and
 implementing improvements in service architecture, both current and future.
  You will be an expert at articulating technical characteristics of your services and the dependencies between services 
  and guide Development teams to engineer and add premier capabilities to the  Cloud service portfolio. 
  Additionally, contribute to implementation of service functionality to solve customer requirements.

Service Monitoring - Define Service Level Objectives (SLO) and implement/monitor Service Level Indicators (SLI) for production services. Aggregate data from multiple monitoring tools, normalize, and build tools and alerts for the overall system health.


Operations Engineering – You will understand and be able to communicate the scale, capacity, security, performance attributes and requirements of the services you own. You are a Subject Matter Expert, able to understand and communicate every characteristic of your service stack, such as: degradation and behavior under load of the services and their dependencies end-to-end tuning needs, optimizing resource utilization, as load patterns fluctuate Instrumentation and metrics that clearly describe the service behaviors scaling requirements and patterns, resiliency and recoverability, ensuring that backup / restore and disaster recovery capabilities are implemented, tested and maintained


Service Automation – You will have a clear understanding of automation and orchestration principles, 
and will be eager to automate, wherever and whenever the possibility arises, while simultaneously eliminating technical debt. 
Automation must be part of your DNA.
